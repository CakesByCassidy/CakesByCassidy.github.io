      <description>section.container img { width: 400px; }  If you have been trying to watch what you eat or are trying to cut back on certain foods, then I am here to help!

      <description>section.container img { width: 400px; }  If you’ve been following me for a while then you know I have an obsession with combining different flavors for the ultimate amount of tastiness.

Some of these are classic combinations most of us have heard of but there is something special about taking a classic and leveling it up.</description>

      <description>section.container img { width: 400px; }  There is nothing worse than going to an event and realizing that you can’t eat any of the desserts because they aren’t gluten free or allergen free. This is something I go through every holiday or occasion. It doesn’t upset me much anymore, but it would be nice to get to a party for once and be greeted by a gluten free cupcake.</description>

      <description>section.container img { width: 400px; }  I once had a chemistry teacher tell me chemistry is a lot like baking but what they should’ve said is that chemistry is a lot easier than baking! If you’re new to baking, I know what you’re thinking, where do I even begin? I would suggest beginning by learning the basic terminology that more advanced and professional bakers use. This will help you better understand what recipes and tutorials call for as well as leading you to become a better baker.</description>

During this busy time of year I look for simple and easy ideas that will both bring the holiday spirit into my home- while remaining as hassle free as possible.</description>
