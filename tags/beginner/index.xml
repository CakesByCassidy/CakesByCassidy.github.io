      <description>section.container img { width: 400px; }  There is nothing worse than going to an event and realizing that you can’t eat any of the desserts because they aren’t gluten free or allergen free. This is something I go through every holiday or occasion. It doesn’t upset me much anymore, but it would be nice to get to a party for once and be greeted by a gluten free cupcake.</description>

      <description>section.container img { width: 400px; }  I once had a chemistry teacher tell me chemistry is a lot like baking but what they should’ve said is that chemistry is a lot easier than baking! If you’re new to baking, I know what you’re thinking, where do I even begin? I would suggest beginning by learning the basic terminology that more advanced and professional bakers use. This will help you better understand what recipes and tutorials call for as well as leading you to become a better baker.</description>
